Have you ever wondered how Remote Code Execution works? 

This happens on sites like HackerRank & competitive programming websites. You write some code then it's executed on another computer(server). The results are then shown to you.

I tried implementing that.

Feel free to go through the code, fix bugs, add new features, e.t.c

## Local Setup

### Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node

Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

###

### Yarn installation

After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the following command.

      $ npm install -g yarn

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/paulonteri/remote-code-execution-environment.git
    $ cd remote-code-execution-environment
    $ cd core && yarn install && cd ../frontend && yarn install && cd ..

## Running the project

To run both the frontend and backend run the `run` script.

```sh
./run
```
