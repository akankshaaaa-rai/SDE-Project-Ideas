# Contributing to the Remote Code Execution System

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to paulonteri/remote-code-execution-environment. Following these guidelines help to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and working on this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes and also helping you finalise your pull requests.

### What do I do? How do I get started?

Follow the [README.md](/README.md) guide. If you've noticed a bug, want to add a feature or have a question, [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/paulonteri/remote-code-execution-environment/issues) to see if someone else already created a ticket. If that has not yet been done, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/paulonteri/remote-code-execution-environment/issues/new).

### Clone & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, [clone paulonteri/remote-code-execution-environment](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and create a branch with a descriptive name. Always checkout from the **staging branch**, that is the default and up-to-date branch.

A good branch name would be:

```sh
git checkout -b 13-fix-cta-button
```

### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes. Feel free to ask for help; everyone was once a beginner; everyone is learning.

The [requirements](/requirements.txt) file contain the packages and dependencies to be installed and set up.

Please ensure that the issue you've fixed is related to the branch you're currently working from. If you want to fix something else unrelated to whatever you've worked on, do another checkout from the staging branch and give the new branch an appropriate name.This makes it easy for the maintainers to track your fixes.

#### Commits
The goal is that each commit has a **single focus**. Each commit should record a single-unit change. Now this can be a bit subjective (which is totally fine), but each commit should make a change to just one aspect of the project.
